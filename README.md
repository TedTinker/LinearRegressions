# LinearRegressions
In PSTAT 126, we use R-Studio to analyze and interpret datasets. 
Here, see my code and its output on some very interesting problems, plus my interpretations and some pure statistical maths.
I cannot upload the original questions, so I hope it is clear from the context what issues I am addressing in each problem.

Thank you!
