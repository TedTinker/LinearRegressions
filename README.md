# LinearRegressions
In PSTAT 126, we use R-Studio to analyze and interpret datasets. Here are some of those projects.
For each question, I've included the R code I used, the output it produced, and my interpretation of graphs and equations. 
Some problems require only a proof, without code. 

Thank you!
